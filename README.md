# WoW Healer Bootcamp

healing game based on World of Warcraft

https://wow-healer-bootcamp.surge.sh/


## Why?

I like Little Healer
[on iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/little-healer/id1029875017?mt=8) and
[on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dmitryvolevodz.littlehealer&hl=en). It's a fun little game, and you should go play try it out.

I figured coming up with something similar would be a fun project.

Also, I wanted to use the following web development frameworks and libraries,
so I could learn about them as I went along:

- [Immutable.js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) by Facebook
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) by Facebook
- [Redux](http://rackt.github.io/redux/index.html)
